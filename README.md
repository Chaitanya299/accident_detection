# ðŸš— Accident Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based system to detect road accidents from video footage. It uses pre-trained CNN architectures like **VGG16**, **VGG19**, and **ResNet50**, along with a custom CNN model, to classify frames as either `Accident` or `No Accident`. Grad-CAM visualizations are used for model explainability.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- âœ… VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
- âœ… VGG19 (Transfer Learning)
- âœ… ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
- âœ… Custom CNN (Built from scratch)

Each model is trained to classify image frames into:
- `Accident`
- `No Accident`
